Check Your Understanding

1. I would not use unit tests to test the "message" feature of a messaging application because there are so many small parts to this feature such as checking if the user is able to write a message, checking if when the user presses send it sends to the correct person, checking if the spell-checks work, etc. Unit testing does not work well for interactions.

2. I would use a unit test to test the "max message length" feature because it is a simple check of length of message and does not have a variety of components and interactions.
